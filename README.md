### Login, Sign up and Main Window with Database Connection
If the user name and password entered in the login window are registered in the database, the user is connected to the Store window. If the entered data is incorrect, a warning message is sent. New users can register from the new window opened with the Sign up link and then connect to the system via Login Window.
